# Patient-Centric-Intelligent-Medicine-Dispenser
## Problem Statement 
Manual medication management is prone to errors, missed doses and reduced treatment effectiveness. Patients, particularly those with complicated medication schedules, struggle to maintain adherence in the absence of a dependable drug administration system.There is a need for a user-friendly and intelligent solution that ensures accurate, timely and safe medication administration, minimizing risks and improving health outcomes.
## Objective
•	To ensure accurate dispensing of medications in the correct dosage, minimizing the risk of errors.  
•	To deliver timely reminders for medication schedules to enhance patient adherence.  
•	To facilitate quick access to essential medications during emergencies, including after pharmacy hours, to support timely treatment of critically ill patients.  
•	To improve operational efficiency for both nursing and pharmacy staff.
## Proposed System
The novelty of the project is, it integrates both solid and liquid pharmaceuticals into a single automated unit.Caregivers can schedule medication alarms remotely via IoT, eliminating the need for physical presence. The system is designed to be simple and user-friendly for both patients and caregivers. A built-in display shows the current date and the scheduled medication time.When the alarm sounds, capsules are released onto a tray and the correct amount of liquid medication is dispensed into a measuring cup. The alarm can be programmed to sound three to five times, ensuring timely medication intake.
